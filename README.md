Game Component build breakdown


1. **Game Initialization**:
    - **StartScreen Component**: This component will display the game's title, a brief description, and a "Start Game" button. It might also have settings or instructions links.

2. **Music Selection**:
    - **MusicSelector Component**: After starting the game, players can select a music track. This component will fetch a list of available 30-second tracks from the Deezer API and display them in a list or grid format. Each track might have a play button for preview, track name, and artist name.

3. **Gameplay**:
    - **GameBoard Component**: This is where the actual gameplay happens. It will display the rotating discs, the score, and a timer.
        - **Disc Component**: A smaller component to represent each rotating disc. It will have its own state to determine if it's spinning, its current angle, and if it's been matched.
        - **ScoreDisplay Component**: A small component to show the current score.
        - **TimerDisplay Component**: Displays the remaining time for the game.

4. **Animations**:
    - **AnimatedDisc Component (with react-spring)**: This will be an enhanced version of the Disc Component, but with animations for spinning, matching, and any other visual effects.
    - **BackgroundVisualizer Component (with three.js)**: This component will display animated visual effects based on the music being played. It's a background component that reacts to the music.

5. **End of Game**:
    - **EndScreen Component**: Once the game is over (either by matching all discs or running out of time), this component will display the final score, a "Play Again" button, and maybe some social share options or links to other games.

6. **API Interaction**:
    - **APIHandler Component (or custom hook)**: This isn't a visual component but a logical one. It will handle all interactions with the Deezer API, such as fetching the list of tracks. If you're using hooks, this could be a custom hook like `useDeezerAPI()`.

7. **Error Handling**:
    - **ErrorDisplay Component**: If there's an error (like failing to fetch tracks from Deezer), this component will display an error message to the user.

8. **General Layout and Styling**:
    - **Layout Component**: This component will handle the general layout of the game, like positioning the GameBoard in the center, setting background colors or images, etc.
    - **Button Component**: A reusable button component for various actions like starting the game, selecting a track, etc.

9. **Optional Enhancements**:
    - **Settings Component**: If you want to provide settings like difficulty levels, this component will handle that.
    - **Instructions Component**: A modal or separate screen that provides instructions on how to play the game.
